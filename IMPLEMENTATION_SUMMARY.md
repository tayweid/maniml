# Implementation Summary - maniml_local Features to maniml

## What Was Implemented

### 1. First Animation Only Execution
Added animation counting to the Scene class:
- `_animations_to_play = 1` - Controls how many animations to play (default: 1)
- `_animations_played = 0` - Tracks how many animations have been played
- Modified `play()` method to check counter and skip animations after the first
- Modified `wait()` method to also respect the animation counter
- When skipping, mobjects are still properly added to the scene

### 2. File Watcher Integration
Enhanced the existing file watcher functionality:
- File watcher is now initialized in `setup()` method
- Sets `_file_changed_flag` when file changes are detected
- `update_frame()` checks this flag and calls `_handle_file_change()`
- File changes trigger intelligent checkpoint-based reloading
- Prints helpful messages about auto-reload status

### 3. Preserved maniml's Checkpoint System
- Did NOT modify the existing checkpoint system as requested
- File changes use the existing checkpoint navigation
- The superior checkpoint system in maniml remains intact

## How to Use

### Running Only First Animation
By default, when you run a scene, only the first animation will play:
```bash
maniml script.py SceneName
```

### File Watching
File watching is enabled by default. When you edit your script:
1. The file watcher detects the change
2. It finds the checkpoint before the changed line
3. It restores to that checkpoint
4. It re-runs animations from that point forward

### Testing
Test files created:
- `test_first_animation.py` - Tests that only first animation plays
- `test_file_watcher.py` - Tests file watching with interactive mode
- `test_simple.py` - Debug test with print statements

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **manim/scene/scene.py**:
   - Added animation counting attributes in `__init__`
   - Modified `play()` to check animation counter
   - Modified `wait()` to check animation counter
   - Enhanced `setup()` to initialize file watcher
   - File change handling already existed and works with checkpoints

2. **manim/__main__.py**:
   - Added filepath passing in the simple runner fallback

### Key Design Decisions
- Minimal changes to preserve existing functionality
- Animation counting is simple and non-invasive
- File watcher uses thread-safe flag approach
- Leverages existing checkpoint system for file change handling
- No modifications to the checkpoint system itself

## Benefits
1. **Faster Development**: Only first animation plays, making iteration quicker
2. **Live Reload**: File changes are detected and handled intelligently
3. **Preserved Quality**: maniml's superior checkpoint system is untouched
4. **Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work
